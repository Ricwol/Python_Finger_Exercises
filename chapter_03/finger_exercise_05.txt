Finger exercise, p.79
The Empire State Building is 102 stories high. A man wanted to know the highest
floor from which he could drop an egg without the egg breaking. He proposed to
drop an egg from the top floor. If it broke, he would go down a floor, and try
it again. He would do this until the egg did not break. At worst, this method
requires 102 eggs. Implement a method that at worst uses seven eggs.

Answer:
To require a maximum of 7 eggs, use the method of bisection search and
linear search.

There are two cases to consider:
1. The egg breaks as it falls, then halve the number of the current floor and
   drop the next egg.
2. The egg remains intact, then repeat the test with the same egg on the next
   higher floor until the egg breaks.

Follow the instructions to use max 7 eggs:
1. Start on the 51 floor and drop the first egg.
   It breaks, halve 51
2. Go to 25 floor and drop the second egg.
   This one also breaks after the drop. 
   Halve 25
3. Go to the 12 floor and drop the third egg.
   It breaks, halve 12
4. Go to the 6 floor and drop the fourth egg.
   It breaks, halve 6
5. Go to the 3 floor and drop the fifth egg.
   It breaks, halve 3
6. Go to the 1 floor and drop the sixth egg.
   It breaks, halve 1. 
7. You have arrived at the first floor and drop the seventh egg.

If this one also breaks, you know that the highest floor from which you can
drop an egg without it breaking does not exist.


Suppose an egg remained intact after falling from the 26th floor.
1. Start again at the 51 floor and drop the first egg.
   It breaks, so cut 51 in half
2. Go to the 25 floor and drop the second egg.
   This time it stays whole. 
3. Now use the second case and go to the 26th floor
   repeat the fall with the second egg.
   It stays whole again
4. Go to the 27 floor.
   This time the egg breaks.

Thus, with only 2 eggs, the highest floor could be found from which an egg
survives the fall unharmed.
