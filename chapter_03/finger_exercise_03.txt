# What would the code (bisection_search.py) in Figure 3-5 do if x = -25?

As the bounds are set to low = 0 and high = max(1, x), with x = -25, the upper
bound will be set to 1. Thus, the number range will be between 0 and 1
excluding the value of -25.
The test condition of the while loop abs(ans**2 - x) >= 0.01 will always be
true as for any ans -> abs(ans**2 - (-25)) will always be at least 25.
The decrement condition isn't met which creates an infinity loop.
The bisection condition trying to find the right value will reduce high each
iteration until it will result 0 too.

So the end result is an infinity loop setting low=0 and high=0 not changing
the ans value anymore. But because of the start condition the value of -25 is
never considered in the first place.
