Finger exercise, p.271
Is merge_sort a stable sort?

A stable sort means that if two elements are equal with respect to the
comparison used in the sort, their relative ordering in the original list is
preserved in the final list.


Answer:
As merge_sort is a divide and conquer algorithm the stability is depending on
the used compare function.

The implementation of merge_sort in Figure 12-5, p.267 is not stable as the
compare function is defined as: compare = lambda x, y: x < y
If we change the "<" to "<=", i.e.: compare = lambda x, y: x <= y
then we create a stable version of merge_sort.
