Finger exercise, p.32

Computers can be annoyingly literal. If you don't tell them exactly what you
want them to do, they are likely to do the wrong thing. Try writing an
algorithm for driving between two destinations. Write it the way you would for
a person, and then imagine what would happen if that person were as stupid as
a computer, and execute the algorithm exactly as written.

Algorithm for driving between two destinations:
Start: Massachusetts College of Art and Design
Address: 621 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115

Destination: MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
Address: 32 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139

For a person:
1. Take Huntington Ave toward the Museum of Fine Arts.
2. Turn left onto Hemenway St until you reach Berklee College.
3. Then go right on Boylston St to turn left at the next opportunity on
   Massachusetts Ave.
4. After you cross the bridge, follow Massachusetts Ave until you make a right
   onto Vassar St. Go to number 32 and you have arrived at the MIT Computer
   Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Execute the algorithm as written for a computer.
1. Could work if computer knows in which direction the Museum of Fine Arts is.
2. Will produce an infinite loop because the statement
   "turn left until Berklee College is reached" is too imprecise as a
   termination condition.
3. Never reached as computer is still turning left as he still hasn't reached
   Berklee College on Hemenway St
4. Same issue as in 3.

Without more information, the computer will not reach the target. In addition,
it does not pay attention to other road users during the execution and would
also not observe any road traffic rules, as well as speed limits.
